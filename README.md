# vocd-dcompute

Python implementation of computing D-optimum from VOCD.
For measuring lexical diversity (LD), a method called _D_ was developed by Malvern et al. The first version of the method was implemented by Brian MacWhinney in C++. Here, you can find a Python version of that implementation.

The original implementation can be found at https://dali.talkbank.org/clan/ (last visited 05.01.2025).

Detailed explanation of D can be found in:
